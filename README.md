This Python code allows you to play a mini-game as a pirate.

ðŸ‘¾TO RUN:
Visual Studio 2022.1 was used for development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
You can play it directly from the IDE or using programs that support the graphical interface of .py files.
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order to avoid encountering errors.
I would like to point out that part of the program was created following a tutorial, but applying many changes, making it original and more particular. (for Hack Club reviewers, the code has already been approved by 2 admins!)
